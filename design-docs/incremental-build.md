# Incremental Build Improvements

This spec defines some improvements to improve incremental build and task up-to-date checks

# General Speed-ups

These are general speed ups that improve all builds.

## Story: Speed up File metadata lookup in task input/output snapshotting

File metadata operations .isFile(), .isDirectory(), .length() and .lastModified are
hotspots in task input/output snapshotting.

The Java nio2 directory walking method java.nio.file.Files.walkFileTree can pass the file
metadata used for directory scanning to "visiting" the file tree so that metadata
(BasicFileAttributes) doesn't have to be re-read.

### Implementation

- For JDK7+ with UTF-8 file encoding, use a nio2 file walker implemention. ✔︎
    - Cache isDirectory()/getSize()/getLastModified() in FileVisitDetails from BasicFileAttributes gathered from walking ✔︎
- Otherwise, use default file walker implementation (current behavior). ✔︎
    - Use a caching FileVisitDetails for getSize()/getLastModified() to cache on first use. ✔︎
    - Maybe reuse isFile/isDirectory result from the walker implementation ✔︎
- Replace calls to getFiles() in DefaultFileCollectionSnapshotter with a visitor ✔︎

### Test coverage

- Test that correct implementation is chosen for JDK platform and file encoding ✔︎
- Test that a file walker sees a snapshot of tree even if the tree is modified after walking has started. ✔︎
- Generate file tree and walk with JDK7+ file walker and non-nio2 file walker. Attributes and files should be the same for both. ✔︎
- Performance gains will be measured from existing performance tests. ✔︎
- Expect existing test coverage will cover behavior of input/output snapshotting and file collection operations. ✔︎

## Story: Reduce the in-memory size of the task history cache by interning file paths

### Implementation

- Use Guava's [`Interners.newWeakInterner()`](http://google.github.io/guava/releases/18.0/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/Interners.html#newWeakInterner%28%29) to create a cache `StringInterner` for sharing the file path Strings. Place this cache in `GlobalScopeServices` so that the instance lives across multiple builds in the daemon.
- use the `StringInterner` to intern all duplicate path names contained in `fileSnapshots`, `taskArtifacts`, `outputFileStates` and `fileHashes` caches.
- Implementation can be based on the solution developed in the spike. The commit is https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commit/d26d4ce1098e0eee9896279cbeabefb1ca3e871c .

### Test coverage

- Add basic unit test coverage for StringInterner
  - interning different string instances with similar content return the first instance that was interned
  - allows calling method with null, returns null in that case

## Story: Add caching to Specs returned from PatternSet.getAsSpecs()

Evaluating patterns is a hotspot in directory scanning. The default excludes patterns
contains 28 entries. Checking all rules for each file sums up in a lot of operations.
Adding caching will improve performance of subsequent incremental builds.

### Implementation

Assumption: PatternSet class is part of the Gradle Public API and we cannot change it's interface.

#### 1. phase - target release Gradle 2.9

Spike commit: https://github.com/lhotari/gradle/commit/f235117fd0b8b125a8220c45dca8ee9dc2331559

- Mainly based on the spike commit
- Move Spec<FileTreeElement> creation logic to separate factory class from PatternSet class (currently in getAsSpec, getAsIncludeSpec, getAsExcludeSpec methods)
- Add caching for Spec<FileTreeElement> instance creation and evaluation results
- Only add caching to Spec<FileTreeElement> instances that are created from the include and exclude patterns.
- A PatternSet can contain a list of includeSpecs and excludeSpecs. Don't add caching to these.

#### Test coverage for 1. phase

- Test that Spec<FileTreeElement> includes (added with PatternSet.include(Spec<FileTreeElement> spec)) and excludes (added with PatternSet.exclude(Spec<FileTreeElement> spec)) are not cached.
- Existing PatternSet tests cover rest of the changes since there are no planned behavioural or API changes for 1. phase.

#### 2. phase - target release Gradle 2.10

Goal: manage the cache instance in Gradle infrastructure instead of a singleton instance
- Use default non-caching PatternSpecFactory in PatternSet class, replace use of CachingPatternSpecFactory with plain PatternSpecFactory
- Make the Gradle infrastructure manage the CachingPatternSpecFactory instance.
- Create a new PatternSet subclass that takes the PatternSpecFactory instance in the constructor.
- Replace usage of PatternSet class with the new subclass in Gradle core code. Wire the CachingPatternSpecFactory instance to the instances of the new PatternSet subclass.

Goal: support suppressing default excludes
- Add support for suppressing the default excludes that are part of Ant integration legacy in Gradle. Default excludes aren't needed when there are specific include patterns. The default excludes support can be added to the same new PatternSet subclass that supports the separate (Caching)PatternSpecFactory.
- make SourceSets in Gradle use the new PatternSet implementation that supports suppressing the default excludes and uses the CachingPatternSpecFactory managed by the Gradle infrastructure (`GlobalScopeServices`)

## Story: Add "discovered" inputs to incremental tasks

This story adds a way for an incremental task to register additional inputs once execution has started.  At the end of execution, the discovered inputs are recorded in the task's execution history.

    void perform(IncrementalTaskInputs inputs) {
      getInputs().getFiles.each { source ->
        File discoveredInput = complicatedAnalysis(source)
        inputs.newInput(discoveredInput)
      }
      if (inputs.incremental) {
        inputs.outOfDate {
          // do stuff
        }
      }
    }

### Implementation

- Add `void newInput(File)` to IncrementalTaskInputs
- Add `Set<File> getDiscoveredInputs()` to IncrementalTaskInputsInternal
- StatefulIncrementalTaskInputs will implement `newInput` and `getDiscoveredInputs` to capture discovered inputs.
- Add new getDiscoveredInputFilesSnapshot/setDiscoveredInputFilesSnapshot methods to TaskExecution and LazyTaskExecution to record a separate discovered FileCollectionSnapshot. This means a task has 3 snapshots (inputs, outputs, discovered inputs).
- Update LazyTaskExecution and CacheBackedTaskHistoryRepository to handle the new discovered inputs snapshot. Maybe there's a higher level extraction that could be done here? The code for inputs/outputs/discovered are all similar.
- Add new DiscoveredInputFilesStateChangeRule that behaves identical to InputFilesStateChangeRule, except there is no input snapshot. Instead, the input snapshot is calculated by getting the hash of all files in the previousExecution's DiscoveredInputFilesSnapshot.
- DiscoveredInputFilesStateChangeRule's snapshotAfterTask action is to take the snapshot of all discovered files and add it to the current execution.
- TaskUpToDateState will use DiscoveredInputFilesStateChangeRule to create another source of TaskStateChanges.  This ties discovered inputs into the up-to-date checks.
- DefaultTaskArtifactStateRepository will be responsible for tying the discovered inputs from IncrementalTaskInputs to the discovered input snapshotting in snapshotAfterTask().

### Test coverage

- Discovered inputs must be Files (not directories).
- On the first build, no discovered inputs are known, so discovered inputs are not needed for up-to-date checks.
- On the second build, discovered inputs from previous build for a task are checked for up-to-date-ness.
- When a discovered input is modified, the task is out of date on the next build.
- When a discovered input is deleted, the task is out of date on the next build.
- The set of discovered inputs after the task executes represents the inputs discovered for that execution, so if on build#1 discovered inputs are A, B, C and on build#2 discovered inputs are D, E, F.  Discovered inputs after #2 should be D, E, F (not a combination).
- A task that is up-to-date should not lose its discovered inputs. Following an up-to-date build, a change in a discovered inputs should cause a task to be out of date.  i.e., A task that discovers inputs A, B, C in build#1, is up-to-date in build #2, should still have discovered inputs A, B, C in build#3.

### Open issues

- If a discovered input is missing when it is discovered, should we treat that as a missing file input or a fatal problem? -- currently this is a fatal problem (files must exist)
- Any change to discovered inputs causes all inputs to be out-of-date -- currently, task is still incremental
- It would be nice to perform discovery incrementally.
- It looks straightforward to not "stream" the hashes into the discovered snapshot and just create it all at once (like the other snapshots do).
- The previous discovered files snapshot can be thrown away as soon as we know we'll be executing.
- Discovered inputs do not work with continuous build.

## Story: Use source #include information as discovered inputs

Based on IncrementalNativeCompiler's #include extractor, add header files as discovered inputs to compile tasks.

### Implementation

- From IncrementalNativeCompiler, add resolved includes to NativeCompileSpec
- From AbstractNativeCompileTask, add resolved includes as discovered inputs to incremental task inputs
- In AbstractNativeCompileTask, use @Input for getIncludes()
- Remove "include hack" from perf tests for 2.10+.  Keep "include hack" for 2.8/2.9, unless they'll build within a reasonable time due to all of the other changes.

### Test coverage

- Reuse existing test coverage
- Measure improvement/regression with native perf tests

### Open issues

- How to deal with missing #include files (macros and missing files)

## Story: Performance test for native incremental build where some files require recompilation

#### Constraints
- Change happens after a previous build, so it is not a clean build
- Needs to be something that causes the linker to run, so not just a comment change

#### Implementation
- modify existing internal Performance testing framework to support measurements for these scenarios
  - callbacks for before and after invocation with the information about the current test invocation
    - test phase: warmup or measurement
    - test loop number
    - maximum number of loops
    - BuildExperimentSpec instance
  - in the before invocation callback, we can make changes to files
  - add ability to omit measurements in the after invocation callback
    - the build invocation that is done before changing files has to be omitted from measurements
- implementation plan for the test:
  - The build is run multiple times. Use the features added in the previous step for implementing the behaviour.
    - on odd build loops, run the build and omit the measurement
    - on even build loops, do the modification and run the build and record the measurement
  - run the build loop 2 times in warmup phase and 10 times in execution phase (modification is made on every second loop).
  - Create 2 new builds for performance tests that are downsized from the `nativeMonolithic` build
    - `smallNativeMonolithic`: 1% of `nativeMonolithic` size
        - use for all 3 scenarios
    - `mediumNativeMonolithic`: 10% of `nativeMonolithic` size
        - use for 2 scenarios (1 file changes, few files change)

example of using `BuildExperimentListener` for testing
```
    @Unroll('Project #type native build 1 change')
    def "build with 1 change"() {
        given:
        runner.testId = "native build ${type} 1 change"
        runner.testProject = "${type}NativeMonolithic"
        runner.tasksToRun = ["assemble"]
        runner.maxExecutionTimeRegression = maxExecutionTimeRegression
        runner.targetVersions = ['2.8', 'last']
        runner.buildExperimentListener = new BuildExperimentListener() {
            @Override
            GradleInvocationCustomizer createInvocationCustomizer(BuildExperimentInvocationInfo invocationInfo) {
                null
            }

            @Override
            void beforeInvocation(BuildExperimentInvocationInfo invocationInfo) {
                if(invocationInfo.loopNumber % 2 == 0) {
                    // do change

                } else if (invocationInfo.loopNumber > 2) {
                    // remove change

                }
            }

            @Override
            void afterInvocation(BuildExperimentInvocationInfo invocationInfo, MeasuredOperation operation, BuildExperimentListener.MeasurementCallback measurementCallback) {
                if(invocationInfo.loopNumber % 2 == 1) {
                    measurementCallback.omitMeasurement()
                }
            }
        }

        when:
        def result = runner.run()

        then:
        result.assertCurrentVersionHasNotRegressed()

        where:
        type     | maxExecutionTimeRegression
        "small"  | millis(1000)
        "medium" | millis(5000)
    }
```


### Scenario: Incremental build where 1 file requires recompilation
- 1 C source file changed

### Scenario: Incremental build where a few files require recompilation
- 1 header file (included in a few source files) changed

### Scenario: Incremental build where all files require recompilation
- 1 compiler option changed

# Unprioritized

## Story: Profiling for native incremental build where some files require recompilation

- Profile and find performance hotspots for the 1 file / few files changed scenarios introduced in the "Performance test for native incremental build where some files require recompilation" story.
- Spike changes for optimizing biggest bottlenecks to be able to find more hotspots that only show up in profiling after reducing/removing the current bottlenecks.
- Document the findings and add stories for doing improvements.

## Story: not loading the file snapshots in up-to-date checking

- Add hash based pre-check phase to up-to-date checking
- pre-check hash is calculated from the list of files sorted by their name
  - the file's name, size and last modified times are added to the hash
  - there are no file content hashes as part of the pre-check hash
- if pre-check hash is same as pre-check for previous snapshot, it is considered up-to-date and the actual file snapshot doesn't have to be loaded
- if pre-check hash is different and snapshot up-to-date check doesn't contain changes (false positive), the persisted hash gets updated
  - this might happen when file modification times are different, but content is the same
- The "fileSnapshots" in-memory cache should use weak references for values.
  - loaded fileSnapshots will get GCd under memory pressure

## Story: Reuse native source file dependency information within a build

Gradle parses each source file to determine the source file dependencies.
Currently this is cached on a per-task basis, meaning it is recalculated many
times when building multiple variants and compiling test suites. We should
instead move this to a cache that is shared across all tasks for a build,
and kept in memory across builds.

## Story: Inline the data from the file hash cache into the task history cache

Change `DefaultFileCollectionSnapshotter` to store (length, last-modified, hash)
in the `FileCollectionSnapshot` implementation it creates. This is referenced by
the task history cache.

When deciding whether something has changed, iterate over the elements of the
`FileCollectionSnapshot` and use the (length, last-modified, hash) from the
snapshot. Do not fetch this information from the file hash cache. If something
has changed, hash it, and add the (length, last-modified, hash) tuple to the
file hash cache. Also make a copy of the snapshot and update it with this new
entry. This copy will be used as the new snapshot in the task history.

What this means is that file hash cache is used only for new and modified files,
which means there’s no point caching these entries in-memory (except perhaps for
the duration of a build). For unmodified files, there’s never a cache miss. When
nothing has changed for a snapshot, we also don’t need to hold a lock on the
cache, which means less work and better concurrency when most snapshots are
unmodified.

### Test coverage

TBD

## Story: Author specifies all files to include in source directory

Currently, all source sets consist of a collection of root directories and a set of
include/exclude patterns. Since we do not distinguish between patterns that have a
single match (path/to/foo.c) and a glob (**/*.c), we must always scan all root
directory paths and check all include and exclude patterns.  It's common for some
projects to have an exhaustive list of all source files and no globbing.  In those
cases, we could avoid directory walking and pattern matching.

### DSL

Introduces a method `source(String, Closure<PatternFilterable-like>)` to `LanguageSourceSet`:

    model {
        components {
            lib(NativeLibrarySpec) {
                sources {
                    cpp {
                        source("src/lib/cpp") // 1. no configuration, assume default pattern for source set
                        source("src/lib/cpp") {
                            // 2. only include patterns
                            include '**/*.cpp', '**/*.c++', '**/*.C'
                        }
                        source("src/lib/cpp") {
                            // 3. mix of explicit files and patterns
                            include 'foo/bar.cpp'
                            include 'baz/**/*.cpp'
                            exclude '**/*.h'
                            exclude 'baz/fubar.cpp'
                        }
                        source("src/lib/cpp") {
                            // 4. only explicit list of files
                            include 'foo/bar.cpp'
                            include 'baz/baz.cpp'
                        }
                        source {
                            // 5. existing API
                            srcDirs 'src/lib/cpp'
                            include 'foo/bar.cpp', 'baz/**/*.cpp'
                            exclude '**/*.h', 'baz/fubar.cpp'
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

1. turns into a file collection with 'src/lib/cpp' as a root dir and some default set of patterns
1. turns into the same thing as #1 with a different set of patterns
1. turns into a union of file collections:
    - file collection with just "foo/bar.cpp" (no scanning needed)
    - file collection root dir 'src/lib/cpp' with include pattern 'baz/**/*.cpp' and exclude pattern '**/*.h'
    - file collection of excluded files 'baz/fubar.cpp' (no scanning needed)
    - union = (a+b)-c
1. is the fastest and turns into a file collection with just a set of files. (no scanning needed)
1. is what we have today.  I think the migration would be
    - Introduce new syntax (release X)
    - Deprecate and warn that old syntax is going away -- part of the warning might be a generated "this is what it would look like" message
    - Remove old API (release X+?), but keep source(Closure) around a bit longer to point people back to the migration path.  We wouldn't honor configuration done with source(Closure) anymore.
1. Figuring out if an include/exclude pattern is really a file would be just checking for '*' in the pattern.

### Things to consider:

- What do the defaults look like and how do they mix with this? e.g., how do I add exclusions without duplicating the default path?

    model {
        components {
            lib(NativeLibrarySpec) {
                cpp {
                    source("src/lib/cpp") {
                        exclude 'fubar.cpp'
                    }
                    // maybe repurpose old syntax to mean "exclude/include patterns for default"?
                    source {
                        exclude 'fubar.cpp'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

## Story: Reduce number of directory scans in up-to-date checks

TBD

## Story: Reduce the in-memory size of the task history cache

1. Discard history that will never be used, eg for tasks that no longer exist,
or that is unlikely to be used, eg for tasks in builds other than the current.
2. Keep a hash of the file snapshots in memory rather than the file snapshots
themselves. It’s only when we need to know exactly which files have changed that
we would need to load up the snapshot.
3. Do something similar for the task properties as well.
4. Reduce the cost of a cache miss, by improving the efficiency of serialisation
to the file system, and reducing the cache size.
5. Reduce the cost of a cache miss, by spooling to an efficient transient second
level cache, and reducing the cache size.

## Open Issues

- Check behavior of Prebuilt Libraries with large number of headers (https://discuss.gradle.org/t/native-performance-issue-with-no-op-builds-with-boost-as-a-dependency)
- See incremental-build-old.md for other ideas and specific issues.
- Profiler support: Skip warm-up or have explicit opt-in for warm up profiling?
  - Conditionally enabling the profiler in the code by using Yourkit API.
- Profiler support: For cross-version tests, skip all versions except the current?
- Profiler support: Do we care about conditionally profiling the CLI and daemon processes (such that the profiling options should be configurable for each)?

## Background information about the in-memory caches

### Task History related caches

File path Strings are duplicated in memory in different in-memory caches. The different in-memory caches in Gradle are:
  - [`fileSnapshots` used in `CacheBackedFileSnapshotRepository`](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/b96e5802f277872b3484947ce9970180b139563a/subprojects/core/src/main/groovy/org/gradle/api/internal/changedetection/state/CacheBackedFileSnapshotRepository.java#L29)
    - key is Long id
    - value is `FileCollectionSnapshot`, serialized with `DefaultFileSnapshotterSerializer`
  - [`taskArtifacts` used in `CacheBackedTaskHistoryRepository`](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/b96e5802f277872b3484947ce9970180b139563a/subprojects/core/src/main/groovy/org/gradle/api/internal/changedetection/state/CacheBackedTaskHistoryRepository.java#L37)
    - key is String, a task path
    - value is `CacheBackedTaskHistoryRepository.TaskHistory`, serialized with `CacheBackedTaskHistoryRepository.TaskHistorySerializer`
  - [`outputFileStates` used in `OutputFilesCollectionSnapshotter`](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/b96e5802f277872b3484947ce9970180b139563a/subprojects/core/src/main/groovy/org/gradle/api/internal/changedetection/state/OutputFilesCollectionSnapshotter.java#L54)
    - key is String, a output directory path
    - value is Long, a random id
  - [`fileHashes` used in `CachingFileSnapshotter`](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/b96e5802f277872b3484947ce9970180b139563a/subprojects/core/src/main/groovy/org/gradle/api/internal/changedetection/state/CachingFileSnapshotter.java#L35)
    - key is String, a file path
    - value is `CachingFileSnapshotter.FileInfo`, serialized with `CachingFileSnapshotter.FileInfoSerializer`
  - [`compilationState` in nativeplatform's `DefaultCompilationStateCacheFactory`](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/language-native/src/main/java/org/gradle/language/nativeplatform/internal/incremental/DefaultCompilationStateCacheFactory.java#L28)
    - key is String, a task path
    - value is `org.gradle.language.nativeplatform.internal.incremental.CompilationState`, serialized with `CompilationStateSerializer`

The in-memory caches are a decorator for the underlying persistent cache. In-memory cache decorators are created in InMemoryTaskArtifactCache and live as part of that instance which is in the `GlobalScopeServices`. Persistent cache instances are typically part of the [`TaskExecutionServices`](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/ef18b81c9ee03cf58a49e69a3c6f5abb4557d8f7/subprojects/core/src/main/groovy/org/gradle/internal/service/scopes/TaskExecutionServices.java#L73-L81) which are in `GradleScopeServices` (instances live for the duration of a single build execution). In-memory cache decorators are only used in the Gradle daemon process.

### Relationship of `fileSnapshots` and `taskArtifacts` caches

The `taskArtifacts` cache contains `TaskHistory` entries. Each `TaskHistory` can contain multiple task executions (`CacheBackedTaskHistoryRepository.LazyTaskExecution`). Each `LazyTaskExecution` contains it's input and output filesnapshots (`FileCollectionSnapshot`).
Input and output instances are lazily loaded from the `fileSnapshots` cache when the `TaskHistory` instance gets loaded in an incremental build.

The life-time of the `TaskHistory` instance can be seen in the
[`SkipUpToDateTaskExecuter.execute`](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/3a0cfd6ac94eb9db4c7884c46ef4f9e973dca114/subprojects/core/src/main/groovy/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/execution/SkipUpToDateTaskExecuter.java#L66) method. The in-memory `TaskHistory` instance is persisted in the call to it's `update` method. This call originates from the `TaskArtifactState.afterTask` call in the `SkipUpToDateTaskExecuter.execute` method.

When the `TaskHistory` gets persisted, it adds the current task execution to the list of executions and limits the number of executions to 3 by removing any additional task executions. When the task execution (`LazyTaskExecution`) gets persisted, the input and output file snapshots get persisted in the `filesnapshots` cache. This serves at least 2 purposes: the filesnapshot don't have to be loaded when the `TaskHistory` is loaded. It also prevents updating the input and output filesnapshots to the persistent storage when the `TaskHistory` instance gets updated. When the `TaskHistory` instance gets updated, all data gets re-serialized to disk.

### Other caches

- `HashClassPathSnapshotter` uses an unbounded cache instantiated in [`GlobalScopeServices`](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/56404fa2cd7c466d7a5e19e8920906beffa9f919/subprojects/core/src/main/groovy/org/gradle/internal/service/scopes/GlobalScopeServices.java#L211-L212)
