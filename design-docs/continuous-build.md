# Continuous Build improvements

## Story: Continuous build will trigger a rebuild when an input file is changed during build execution

### Current implementation

Currently continuous build registers inputs for watching after the build is completed. 
Changes that happen after a task is executed, but before the file watching starts, will remain unnoticed.

The current interfaces of `FileSystemChangeWaiter` is:
```java
public interface FileSystemChangeWaiter {
    void wait(FileSystemSubset taskFileSystemInputs, BuildCancellationToken cancellationToken, Runnable notifier);
}
```

### Implementation plan

To be able to detect changes during the running build, the file watching should start before the task is executed.
The current `FileSystemChangeWaiter` interface should be replaced (or modified) to support this.

The inputs for a task are registered for watching just before the task is executed in the build.

Usage of `FileSystemSubset.Builder` in `registerWatchPoints` method of `FileCollectionInternal` interface should be replaced with an interface that has the registration methods on it and so that registering inputs doesn't have to be coupled with `FileSystemSubset`.

The current code in [ContinuousBuildActionExecuter](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/fe03c3d452b6c04a152f4485e7598c0a4f295340/subprojects/launcher/src/main/java/org/gradle/launcher/exec/ContinuousBuildActionExecuter.java#L112-L117):

```java
.           FileSystemSubset.Builder fileSystemSubsetBuilder = FileSystemSubset.builder();
            try {
                lastResult = executeBuildAndAccumulateInputs(action, requestContext, actionParameters, fileSystemSubsetBuilder, buildSessionScopeServices);
            } catch (ReportedException t) {
                lastResult = t;
            }
```

`FileSystemSubset.Builder` should be replaced with a handle that registers the inputs immediately for watching. 

The current implementation in `DefaultFileSystemChangeWaiter` (which might be renamed) should be modified to expose a registration interface. The `FileWatcher` should also support registering new inputs after it has been initialized. 

Implementation details can be planned further after spiking the changes in the areas mentioned above.

### Test coverage

- all current continuous build tests should pass

- add test scenario with a build with tasks A, B, C, D each having it's own directory as input. Tasks have dependencies so that B depends on A, C on B and D on C. Request building task D.
  - change input files to tasks after each task has been executed, but before the build has completed
    - check that a new build gets triggered
  - change input file for task during the task is executed
    - check that a new build gets triggered
  - build executes and fails in task C
    - change input file to D
      - no build will be triggered because of the way how inputs are registered. 
        - similar behavior in current continuous build
    - change input file of task B
      - a new build gets triggered
    - change input file of task C
      - a new build gets triggered

### Open issues

- Jar task needs this fix to prevent looping: https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commit/d629a86afbc25c6d1814b1c4e66f9a39a343df0c

## Story: Print the path of the task to console whose input changed

This is an extension to the story "Continuous build will trigger a rebuild when an input file is changed during build execution". When a change is detected, the path of the task whose input changed should be printed to the console. 

This helps the user find out the reason which triggered the build. It is possible that a continuous build keeps re-triggering new builds when the user isn't doing any changes. This happens when a task changes it's own inputs during execution or when a task changes the inputs of a task that has been executed in the build before it. The user should fix such builds since continuous build will not prevent such loops.

## Story: Provide quick feedback to user in continuous build

This is an extension to the story "Continuous build will trigger a rebuild when an input file is changed during build execution". 

There are several options for providing the feedback quickly to the user:

1. A) When a change is detected, the currently executing build is canceled. After a quiet period a new build is triggered.
2. B) When a change is detected and a build is currently executing, use an adaptive solution to complete the current build.
  - skip tasks that are non-incremental such as test execution tasks
  - complete incremental tasks such as compilation tasks

The implementation strategy will be chose when this story is designed and reviewed.

### Test coverage

- all current continuous build tests should pass

Assuming A) implementation strategy is chosen:
- additional test cases for test scenario with a build with tasks A, B, C, D each having it's own directory as input. Tasks have dependencies so that B depends on A, C on B and D on C. Request building task D.
  - change input files to tasks after each task has been executed, but before the build has completed
    - check that the currently running build gets canceled and a new build gets triggered
  - change input file for task during the task is executed
    - check that the currently running build gets canceled and a new build gets triggered

## Story: Detecting changes to build files or files that are input to the build configuration phase

TBD

## Story: Continuous build does not trigger rebuild when an intermediate file is changed

The current implementation of continuous build registers to watch changes to the input files of all tasks that are executed. 

Benefits of not watching for changes in intermediate files:
- Some builds might end up in a loop when their intermediate files keep changing. These builds would be able to use continuous build mode without changing the build logic.

- It would reduce file system I/O when we watch for changes in less files.

Intermediate files are outputs from one task and inputs to another task in the same task graph.

TBD


# Open issues

- When running with the daemon, use of EOT to cancel the build requires an extra 'enter' due to the line buffering performed by the daemon client

> In practice, this isn't too big of an issue because most shells intepret ctrl-d as closure of stdin, which doesn't suffer this buffering problem.

- Interactive cancellation on windows requires pressing enter (https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-3311)
